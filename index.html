                        <p class="lead"> I am a 20 year old graphic designer. I fell in love with graphic design in my first semester of college. Originally, I was a digital art major when one of my assignments was to design a packaging for a chocolate bar. It was really cool to create something like that. After that, I decided to research a lot about graphic design. I eventually changed my major. </p>
                        <p class="mb-0">I plan to graduate with an Associates degree in Graphic Design May 2023. During my years in college, I've created some designs that I am really proud of. Check out the rest of my website to see more. </p>

I got the pleasure of working with one of the coordinators from NC3ADL. My logo will be used in their conference in 2023. My name will be included in the conference booklet alongside my logo.</p>
